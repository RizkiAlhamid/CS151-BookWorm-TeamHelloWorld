State the problem/issue to resolve 
  Our local library management system faces several challenges, including poor user interface, slow search times, and substandard data organization. These issues result in a lack of efficiency, longer wait times and an overall frustrating user experience. There is a critical need to upgrade and modernize this library management system to enhance the library’s effectiveness and provide a more user-friendly environment. 
  
If applicable, describe assumptions / operating environments / intended usage 
 - Operating System: Windows, macOS, Linux
 - Environment: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on the user's desktop computer.
 - Intended usage: The intended usage for BookWorm is as a Library Management System. It can be used to organize book inventory, manage users, perform check-ins and check-outs, and search and discover all available books.
  
High-level description of your solution which may include (but is not limited to), your plan and approach.  Be as specific as possible. 
 - Poor user interface: Our current local library management system has a cluttered user interface with an outdated design which makes it very difficult to perform the simplest of tasks. BookWorm plans to create a minimalist and clean user interface with an intuitive design that makes its users efficient in performing their intended tasks.
 - Slow search times: Our current local library management system takes a significant amount of time to search for relevant books and display the results to the user. BookWorm plans to use a fast search algorithm to improve search time and integrate pagination on the front end to ensure faster delivery of results and better user experience. 
 - Substandard data organization: Our current local library management system does not have a well-organized database which makes the search and discovery process longer than it needs to be. BookWorm plans to use Object Oriented Design and proper sorting algorithms to organize user and inventory data to ensure faster access when required.
